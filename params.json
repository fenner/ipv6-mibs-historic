These documents\r\nwere marked in the RFC Index as obsoleting the corresponding\r\nIPV6-MIBs, but the extracted content of these MIBs never changed in\r\nMIB repositories, and the original RFCs (as is normal IETF policy)\r\nnever changed from being Proposed Standard.\r\n\r\nThis causes an unclear situation when simply looking at MIB\r\nrepositories, so we are reclassifying the original documents\r\n([RFC2452], [RFC2454], and [RFC2465]) as historic.\r\n\r\nThe current draft is [here](no-more-v6-mibs.txt).\r\n\r\nThe current draft of the IESG status change document, reclassifying RFC24xx to historic\r\nis [here](status-change-ipv6-mib-to-historic.txt)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
