In 2005, the IPv6 MIB update group published updated versions of the
IP-MIB [RFC4293], UDP-MIB [RFC4113], TCP-MIB [RFC4022] and IP-
FORWARD-MIB [RFC4292], which use the InetAddressType/InetAddress
construct to handle IPv4 and IPv6 in the same table.  These documents
were marked in the RFC Index as obsoleting the corresponding
IPV6-MIBs, but the extracted content of these MIBs never changed in
MIB repositories, and the original RFCs (as is normal IETF policy)
never changed from being Proposed Standard.

This causes an unclear situation when simply looking at MIB
repositories, so we are reclassifying the original documents
([RFC2452], [RFC2454], and [RFC2465]) as historic.

A companion document simply republishes these documents with the
SMI syntax changed to obsolete.
